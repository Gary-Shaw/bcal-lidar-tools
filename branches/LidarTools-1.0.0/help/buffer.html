<H2>Using "Buffer LAS Files"</H2>

<p>
This tool is meant to buffer neighboring LAS files such that they will overlap geographically.

<h3>Usage:</h3>
<p>

<ul>
<li>Select the input files to buffer.  
<li>Input the desired buffer distance, in units of the horizontal coordinates of the data.  This will be the amount by which the new files will overlap.
<li>Select the output directory.  The output files will be saved in the new directory with the same name as the input files.
</ul>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>This tool requires data that are in the LAS format.
<li>This tool was developed for use with the <a href="filter.html">filtering</a> and <a href="raster.html">rasterization</a> tools, in order to overcome difficulties near tile seams.  If the data files are buffered before further processing, the results should be seamless.
</ul>
