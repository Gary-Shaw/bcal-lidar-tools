=Installation Instructions=
  # You will need ENVI 4.x or above pre-installed in your computer. These tools have not been tested for other versions of ENVI.
  # [http://code.google.com/p/bcal-lidar-tools/downloads/list Download] the Lidar Tools Zip file. Unzip the file in the "save_add" folder of your ENVI installation. On my computer, this folder is located at: "C:\Program Files\ITT\IDL71\products\enviXX\save_add\"
  # Start ENVI
  # BCAL LiDAR tools will be located under a new "BCAL LiDAR" button in the ENVI display between the "Topographic" and "Radar" menus
  # The tools have been tested to work for ENVI 4.7 and 4.8. If it is not working for your version of ENVI, the best option would be to [http://code.google.com/p/bcal-lidar-tools/source download the source codes], and recompile the program in your machine.
