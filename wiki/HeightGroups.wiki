#summary Create Vegetation Height Groups

=Using "Create Vegetation Height Groups"=

This tool is meant to separate input LAS file into user-specified vegetation height groups.  This kind of separation can be useful for performing analysis in voxel space. 

Input LAS file must be [HeightFiltering height filtered]. If the LAS file is height filtered outside BCAL LiDAR tools, LAS file should be [PrepareLAS pre-processed] before running through this tool.

==Usage:==

  * Select the input LAS file.
  * Add vegetation height groups you want to create.
  * Select the output directory. 
  * Click 'Run' button. The output LAS files, one for each vegetation height group, will be saved in the new output directory.

==Notes:==

  * This tool requires data that are in the LAS format.
  * Vegetation height values should be multiplied by the Z scale factor to calculate heights in the map projection units.
